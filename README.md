### Algorithmic composition is the technique of using algorithms to create music. This piece is written in SuperCollider, a dynamically typed, garbage-collected, single inheritance object-oriented and functional language similar to Smalltalk with syntax similar to Lisp or the C programming language.

#### I designed my own GUI for this piece, which is a set of volume controls for each synth as well as for the audio sample, implemented through buses. Notes are outputed to the screen to log the changes in chords as they happen. The routines rely on variables so different tempos can be implemented by changing only a single line.

#####Written mostly over the course of five hours on a Saturday night in New York.
